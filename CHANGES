[2.1-SNAPSHOT]
- Compiles with Java 8 now. It's 2018, folks!
- Refactored I/O to use NIO and try-with-resources where appropriate. Removed dependency on Apache commons I/O.
- Print usage (--help) if no command line arguments are given.
- Added more validation checks to configuration parameters.
- Fixed crash when classpath is a directory. (#90)
- Added "cachejre" option to cache results of JRE extract & minimize steps.
- Added "removelibs" option to specify JAR files which are subject for removal of platform libraries. If this parameter isn't used, it defaults to a copy of "classpath", which is the old behaviour.
- Added NvOptimusEnablement and AmdPowerXpressRequestHighPerformance symbols. (#114)
